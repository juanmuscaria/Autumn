# Autumn
Picking apart Spring Framework components and making them standalone!

## About
This is a small personal project that takes certain Spring components and makes them standalone. I've had several
moments that I wished I could take a certain Spring feature without needing the entire framework,
while keeping an almost identical API interface, that's why this project exists.

## TODO
99% of everything is copy-pasted and needs proper reviewing to ensure it works,
as well as documenting where it diverges from spring itself. 

# Credits
* [Spring Framework](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/) - This entire project is a direct copy from Spring components with small adaptations to make
them work outside Spring.
